This case study is related  to 2 people George and Martha working in a company . 
George Montgomery has worked at a firm for several years and is now missing. Another employee, Martha, is also missing. No one knows where
they are or has seen them in over a week, so Steve (George’s supervisor) asks the IT Department to confiscate George’s hard drive and all
storage media in his work area. 
We are having the image file of George’s hard drive and storage media. 
For this we use FTK imager tool to analyze the image files and to recover deleted files and to investigate their case so as to find out
what crime they have committed and how they did this crime.
