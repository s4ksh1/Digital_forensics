Digital forensics is the branch of forensics science which includes the identification, recovery, investigation,validation and reporting
the facts regarding the digital evidences. Digital evidences can be found on computers, digital cameras or any other storage device. We 
can say that it is a process of uncovering and explaining the data found on digital devices. The main goal of forensics is preserving 
the data(evidence) in its most original form by following proper chain of custody. 
Digital forensics is used both in criminal law and private investigation. The data found in digital devices is accepted as an evidence in 
the court of law to prove a particular crime.  
Digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but with the advancement in technology, it has been expanded to
cover the forensics(investigation) of all types of digital devices(like, Mobile phones, Digital cameras, various storage devices).

There are various tools used by the forensics investigator for examination. These tools can provide live analysis, Data viewer, Data
recovery, live memory capture, etc. These tools can create exact copy of the evidence which makes investigation more easier. Investigator
can work on the copy which eliminates the risk of tampering the original evidence. 

In general tools can be broken down into the following ten categories:

1. Disk and data capture tools
2. File viewers
3. File analysis tools
4. Registry analysis tools
5. Internet analysis tools
6. Email analysis tools
7. Mobile devices analysis tools
8. Mac OS analysis tools
9. Network forensics tools
10. Database forensics tools
